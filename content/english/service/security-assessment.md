Kubernetes is well-known for its topnotch security assessment. It helps make clusters, containers and workloads safer thanks to a good amount of security controls in its possession. 

Unfortunately, it doesnâ€™t provide advanced security surveillance. Adopting the right security best practices and regularly fixing prevalent security issues assure maintaining the workflow and safety of kubernetes environments.  

A few best practices for Kubernetes security assessment include securing codes and dependencies, container-based images as well as added layers, using a supported kubernetes distribution service, managing configurations of the container engine and workloads, and choosing the appropriate container assessment security tool.

Some of the most common security issues that most users are dealing with are the inevitability of self-configuration, absence of certain built-in security controls/features, and difficulty for non-experts to deploy workloads easily.
 
To fix these issues, Kubenetes provides a variety of security assessment tools for running clusters and monitoring workloads that focus on behavioral analysis, network monitoring, logging, networking and storage. 

One of the most important tools that ensure the safety of clusters are Kubernetes vulnerability scanners. Tools like Kubesec and kube-bench help identify early-stage cluster failure, keep users up-to-date with cluster health, and spot, prevent and remove vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. 

In order to reduce security vulnerabilities and hacker threats in kubernetes environments, security assessment solutions should cover cluster and workload configuration, infrastructure and workload security, and kubernetes networking.
