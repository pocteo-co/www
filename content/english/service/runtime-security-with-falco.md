Falco is a cross-platform cloud-native runtime security tool. It spots unpredicted risks in containers and immediately alerts on application misbehavior, which makes it the go-to threat detection engine for Kubernetes.

### Kubernetes Audit Logs

Falco is integrated with Kubernetes API audit logs to warn against malicious activity, and when it is plugged into security response workflows and processors, policy breaches can be identified.

### Rules

Thanks to Falco, you can create a set of rules that mark out unforseen application behavior and CVE exploits using community-sourced detection. 

### Use cases

Falco can detect incidents like unexpected readings of sensitive files, shells running inside pods in kubernetes, and containers running in privileged mode or mounting a sensitive path.

Falco fortifies container/cloud security by clocking abnormal actions like file access, new logins and system calls, and notifying users about them. It facilitates consuming kernel events by enhancing them with data from Kubernetes. 

With the help of this tool, high-risk behavior can be prevented very quickly across workloads, making it the optimal policy engine for Kubernetes environments.
